Hey, you![p]
I heard you got sexually harassed by that brute Nikuyama.[p]
Is that true?[p]

Seriously, seriously.[p]
He said something about a body measurement and tried to take off my clothes.[p]
It was super creepy.[p]
#Miyoshi
Hey, seriously?![p]
S-So, what did you do about it?[p]
#Akai
I immediately ran away and told Kirishima-sensei about it.[p]
They told me to leave it to them.[p]
#Miyoshi
That muscle idiot is seriously not joking around.[p]
Next time, I'll beat him to a pulp![p]
#Akai
Stop it.[p]
Kirishima-sensei was really angry, so Nikuyama will probably get fired soon.[p]
Let's go home before that.[p]

Ah, Mr.[p]
Nikuyama.[p]
#Nikuyama
It's rare to see you still here on campus.[p]
Isn't your usual welcoming committee here?[p]
#Fujino
Ah, yes.[p]
Lately, I've been asking them to stop picking me up and dropping me off.[p]
#Nikuyama
Oh, is that so?[p]
Why is that?[p]
#Fujino
It's not like my house is particularly far compared to others...[p]
I also just want to commute to school like everyone else.[p]
#Nikuyama
Hmmm...[p]
Well, if they're always being picked up and dropped off by car, they probably can't make any detours.[p]
But I wonder if their parents are worried?[p]
Like, worried about the possibility of kidnapping or something.[p]
#Fujino
Yes, my father opposed it, but my mother allowed me because she thinks it's important to experience various things.[p]
Today, I'm also planning to be taken to the convenience store by a classmate for the first time after this.[p]
#Nikuyama
Convenience store...?[p]
For the first time...?[p]
#Fujino
Yes, I've actually been wanting to go there for a while...[p]
Oh, but isn't it against the school rules to make detours and go shopping on the way home...?[p]
#Nikuyama
Nah, I don't really care about that kind of stuff.[p]
#Fujino
Ah...[p]
I'm glad, thank you.[p]
Oh, it seems a classmate has arrived.[p]

But it seems like they're more of a princess than I thought if going to the convenience store is their first time.[p]
If I were to make a move on Fujino and it got exposed, there's no way I could just brush it off.[p]

(Tch, they're being cautious because of the brainwashing attempt) (Right now, my target is Kirishima.[p]
This person doesn't matter.[p]
I should clear up any misunderstandings) About the massage we talked about before.[p]
It was just a miscommunication, so forget about it.[p]

Eh, is that so?[p]
When I talked to Kirishima-sensei, they said they would take care of it somehow...[p]

Ah, I talked to Kirishima-sensei and cleared up the misunderstanding, so it's okay.[p]

I was surprised because I thought Mr.[p]
Nikuyama was trying to do something lewd.[p]
There's no way that would happen to someone like me.[p]

But make sure you don't get caught.[p]
If you do, I won't cover for you.[p]
#Male student
Y-Yes.[p]
#Nikuyama
But are you bringing a camera to school?[p]
And it looks quite expensive.[p]
#Male student
Well, I mean, you're the advisor of the photography club, right, Sensei Nikuyama?[p]
#Nikuyama
What?...[p]
Come to think of it, I was the advisor of the photography club.[p]
I completely forgot since I never showed up (I took on the role because I didn't want to be bothered with being the advisor of the judo club).[p]
But I wonder if we had any members like you...?[p]
#male student
Male student: I'm Tabata from the second year.[p]
I'm technically the vice president...[p]
#Nikuyama
Vice president?[p]
But if I remember correctly, there were only about five club members, right?[p]
#Tabata
Well, technically there are about seven members on the roster...[p]
but most of them rarely show up, so there are only two of us who are actively participating in club activities.[p]
#Nikuyama
I see.[p]
What kind of activities are you doing?[p]
#Tabata
We take photos of landscapes and submit them to competitions.[p]
#Nikuyama
How boring.[p]
Don't you have any swimsuit photos of female students?[p]
#Tabata
There's no way we have that kind of thing.[p]
Even if we could, I would want to do it...[p]
but there's no way there would be any girls who would be willing to become models.[p]
#Nikuyama
Well, I guess that's true.[p]
Just do your best so that the club doesn't get disbanded.[p]
It would be troublesome for me if it did.[p]
#Tabata
Well then, I guess I'll be going now...[p]

I have no recollection of that at all, but the photography club doesn't have any decent members.[p]

#Kimoto
Yes, well...[p]
But I specialize in cosplay photography, so I don't really do much at school.[p]
I go to events like Comiket and cosplay events to take pictures.[p]
#Nikuyama
Oh, so you're one of those camera boys who aim for cosplay photos or panty shots?[p]
#Kimoto
N-No, I purely see cosplay as a form of art...[p]
#Nikuyama
Hmph, when it comes to cosplay, it's all about seeing it with a perverted gaze.[p]
The people themselves are doing it because they want to be seen that way.[p]
#Kimoto
W-Well...[p]
I can't deny that aspect either...[p]
#Nikuyama
Cosplay photography isn't bad.[p]
Let's do it as a club activity.[p]
Let's make the female students cosplay.[p]
#Kimoto
It would be nice if that were possible...[p]
but there are no students who would be willing to become models.[p]
#Nikuyama
...[p]
Well, I guess so.[p]
With this many students, it wouldn't be strange to have a few girls hiding and doing cosplay even if you approach them.[p]
If a photoshoot is decided, let me know.[p]
Well then...[p]

a student?[p]
Are you kidding me?[p]
#Girl
It's true.[p]
I'm Tsuyama Sanae from 1-B.[p]
#Nikuyama
Are you really a student here?[p]
You definitely look like an elementary school student...[p]
Oh, could it be that you're a child prodigy who skipped grades?[p]
#Tsuyama
No, I enrolled here just like everyone else.[p]
It's true that I often get mistaken for a child because of my appearance, but...[p]
I am a legitimate student of this school.[p]
#Nikuyama
Hmm...[p]
I can't believe it.[p]
How tall are you?[p]
#Tsuyama
I am 139cm tall.[p]
#Nikuyama
What about your weight?[p]
#Tsuyama
I weigh about 32kg.[p]
#Nikuyama
What are your measurements?[p]
#Tsuyama
I can't answer that.[p]
#Nikuyama
Hmm...[p]
What is your favorite food?[p]
#Tsuyama
It's pudding.[p]
#Nikuyama
What is your favorite hobby?[p]
#Tsuyama
It's jump rope.[p]
#Nikuyama
You really are an elementary school student, huh?[p]
#Tsuyama
No, that's not correct.[p]
#Nikuyama
What is your favorite movie?[p]
#Tsuyama
It's Tonari no Totoro.[p]
#Nikuyama
What is your dream job for the future?[p]
#Tsuyama
I want to be a cake shop owner.[p]
#Nikuyama
Aren't you in the lower grades of elementary school?[p]
#Tsuyama
No, I have my student handbook properly.[p]
#Nikuyama
Hmm, it seems I have no choice but to believe it's genuine.[p]
#Tsuyama
I'm glad you believe me.[p]
Since there's nothing else, I'll go home now.[p]

Today, I'll do my rounds again...[p]
Hm?[p]
It seems like the students are making a commotion.[p]
#Nikuyama
Hey, what's going on?[p]
#Female Student A
Oh, Mr.[p]
Nikuyama, the window glass...[p]

#Nikuyama
Ah, the glass is broken.[p]
Who did it?[p]
Did anyone see the culprit?[p]
#Female Student A
No, I didn't see.[p]
When I came, it was already broken.[p]
#Nikuyama
Is that true?[p]
You're not trying to protect the culprit, are you?[p]
Just be honest and tell me.[p]
#Female Student A
Y-Yes, it's true.[p]
#Nikuyama
What about the others?[p]
Did no one see anything?[p]
#Male Student A
I didn't see anything.[p]
#Nikuyama
Hmm, no one saw anything, huh?[p]
It's probably the work of those delinquents.[p]
#Female Student B
Oh, come to think of it...[p]
#Nikuyama
Huh, what is it?[p]
#Female Student B
Oh, um...[p]
#Nikuyama
What is it?[p]
Do you have any idea who the culprit might be?[p]
#Female Student B
Well, there was someone playing around here a little while ago...[p]
#Nikuyama
Oh, that's valuable information.[p]
Who was it?[p]
#Female Student B
It was the Shiba-kun and his friends from Class B.[p]
#Nikuyama
What about Shibata and his friends?[p]
Ah, those troublemakers.[p]
What were they doing here?[p]
#Female Student B
I didn't see it clearly, but they seemed to be throwing something at each other...[p]
#Nikuyama
The window wasn't broken at that time, right?[p]
#Female Student B
Yes.[p]
#Nikuyama
I see, so Shibata and his friends were playing here, and then the window was broken.[p]
Most likely, they were playing catch or something and accidentally broke the window, so they hurriedly ran away.[p]
It's just like those scumbags to do something like that.[p]
#Female Student A
But I don't think it's been determined that Shibata-kun is the culprit yet.[p]
He may be a delinquent, but he's not that bad of a person...[p]
#Nikuyama
No, based on the evidence and their usual behavior, there's no doubt.[p]
It's definitely them.[p]
#Male Student A
They certainly always make a lot of noise and cause trouble, so it's possible they did it.[p]
#Female Student B
That's right.[p]
#Nikuyama
I'll think about what to do with them.[p]
For now, bring cleaning tools because I'll clean up the glass.[p]
#Female Student A
Yes, Shibata-kun![p]
#Shibata
Hey, what's wrong everyone?[p]
Why the serious faces?[p]
Huh?[p]
The glass is broken![p]
Who did it?[p]
#Nikuyama
You're the one who did it, right?[p]
Stop putting on a pathetic act after doing it yourself.[p]
#Shibata
Eh...?[p]
Me...!?[p]
I didn't do it![p]
Why are you blaming me for it!?[p]
#Nikuyama
There are witnesses who saw it.[p]
I know that you guys were playing catch here.[p]
#Shibata
Catch ball...?[p]
...[p]
N-No![p]
I wasn't playing catch ball![p]
#Nikuyama
Don't lie.[p]
There are people who saw you idiots throwing something back and forth here.[p]
#Shibata
We were certainly playing here...[p]
but we were just flying paper airplanes![p]
#Female Student B
Eh...[p]
paper airplanes...?[p]
#Shibata
That's right![p]
Even we wouldn't be stupid enough to play catch with a hard ball in a hallway with windows.[p]
#Nikuyama
Well, it wouldn't be surprising if you guys did it.[p]
You have a history of causing various incidents, like when you set off a fire extinguisher before.[p]
#Shibata
Ah, I did do that...[p]
but I didn't run or hide![p]
I admit what I did.[p]
But this time, it wasn't me![p]
#Nikuyama
Hmph, don't act all high and mighty, you piece of trash.[p]
You can say whatever you want with your mouth.[p]
#Shibata
W-...[p]
Why are you trying to pin this on us without any evidence![p]
We didn't do it...![p]
#Nikuyama
I don't need any evidence.[p]
Just the fact that you guys are trash is enough.[p]
If you want to hold a grudge, then come to the staff room and blame your own stupidity.[p]
#Shibata
Damn it...![p]
#Kirishima

#Female Student A
Ah, Kirishima-sensei![p]
#Kirishima
What's all this commotion?[p]
Please explain.[p]
#Nikuyama
As you can see, we're taking this Shibata to the staff room because they broke the window glass.[p]
#Shibata
I didn't do it![p]
#Kirishima
It seems like they are denying it?[p]
#Nikuyama
What?[p]
They're just desperately lying.[p]
They're a person with no sense of dignity.[p]
#Shibata
I really didn't do it![p]
Please believe me, Kirishima-sensei![p]
#Kirishima
What evidence is there that Shibata is the culprit?[p]
#Nikuyama
There is a student who witnessed Shibata and others playing catch in this hallway.[p]
#Shibata
I was just flying a paper airplane![p]
I wasn't playing catch or anything![p]
#Kirishima
Who is this student who witnessed it?[p]
#Female Student B
Student B: U-um, it was me.[p]
But I only glanced and...[p]
I just said that Shibata and the others were throwing something and playing.[p]
#Nikuyama
That's enough.[p]
They were playing and throwing something.[p]
Right after that, the glass broke.[p]
It's clear who the culprit is.[p]
#Shibata
I didn't do it![p]
#Kirishima
...[p]
I believe in Shibata-kun.[p]
#Shibata
Kirishima-sensei...![p]
#Nikuyama
Are you really going to trust this scumbag?[p]
Haha, playing the role of a good teacher who believes in their favorite students again, huh?[p]
Education doesn't work with just sweet and naive ideals like that![p]
Sometimes, strictness is necessary too.[p]
#Kirishima
I believe that Shibata-kun is not the kind of student who would lie, but that's not all.[p]
Please look at the glass.[p]
#Nikuyama
Huh?[p]
#Kirishima
If they were playing catch in the hallway and broke the glass, the shards should have scattered outward.[p]
But as you can see, the shards are scattered on the inside of the hallway.[p]
In other words, the window glass was definitely broken from the outside.[p]
#Male Student A
Y-Yes, indeed...![p]
#Nikuyama
From the outside...?[p]
That's stupid, we're on the third floor.[p]
Who the hell do you think did it?[p]
#Kirishima
That is...[p]
#？？
???[p]
: Ah, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.[p]
I'm the one who broke the glass.[p]
#Nikuyama
Hm...[p]

So, in other words, you were trying to film a promotional video for the school and accidentally broke the window while flying a drone.[p]
Is that correct?[p]
#President
Hmm, I apologize for causing a disturbance.[p]
Old folks shouldn't get carried away, hahaha.[p]
Well then, I'll take care of the cleanup and repair arrangements.[p]
I'm really sorry about this.[p]
#Nikuyama
Ah, yes.[p]
I'll leave the rest to you...[p]
Geez, what a troublesome old man.[p]
#Female Student A
I'm glad the suspicion has been cleared, Shibata-kun.[p]
#Shibata
H-Hey, I told you so.[p]
If it was me, I would have confidently admitted to doing it myself...[p]
But, thank you, Kirishima-sensei.[p]
Thank you for believing in me.[p]
#Kirishima
It is only natural for a teacher to believe in their students.[p]
I know that you are not a fundamentally rotten person.[p]
#Shibata
...[p]
Heh, only Kirishima-sensei would say something like that...[p]
It's messing with my head somehow.[p]
#Male Student A
I also had doubts about Shibata-kun in my heart.[p]
I'm sorry.[p]
#Shibata
It's fine.[p]
#Female Student B
But Kirishima-sensei is amazing.[p]
It's impressive that they deduced that the window was broken from the outside just by taking one look, and they never doubted Shibata-kun from the beginning.[p]
#Female Student A
That's right.[p]
If it were any other teacher, they would have just pinned the blame on Shibata-kun and called it a day...[p]
#Kirishima
It's not that big of a deal.[p]
...[p]
Although there are some teachers who don't even bother to see the truth and just label their students as trash.[p]
#Nikuyama
Ugh...[p]
Hmph, it's because of my bad behavior that I'm being suspected in times like this.[p]
It's my own fault![p]
#Male Student A

#Female Student A
(This is the worst...[p]

#Nikuyama
Then you guys should clean up the glass.[p]

(Come to think of it, that was the case) Yes, that's right.[p]

But this is troublesome.[p]
Having someone wandering around the school in such attire...[p]

Ah, I see.[p]
So, should we really not give them a warning?[p]
Hmm, however...[p]
#Nikuyama
Please.[p]
And while it may deviate from the norm a bit, it's not really that obscene.[p]
From a teacher's perspective, it's just...[p]
well, somewhat normal these days.[p]

I-Is that so?[p]
It looked quite obscene...[p]
Is that the norm these days?[p]
#Nikuyama
Well, I don't think it's something to be so concerned about.[p]

I-I see.[p]
In that case, let's not make it a problem for now.[p]

How did Ayame do?[p]

I got a perfect score of 100.[p]

Guha![p]
It was a mistake to ask Ayame.[p]
Why does they always get a perfect score of 100 every time?[p]
#Fujino
It's thanks to Kirishima-sensei's wonderful lessons.[p]
If you properly take Kirishima-sensei's classes, anyone should be able to improve their English.[p]
#Hayase
I'm also taking Kirishima-sensei's classes, you know...[p]
Ayame's love for Kirishima-sensei is still amazing, as always.[p]

But it's just that Kirishima-sensei is an amazing teacher...[p]
#Hayase
Yeah, yeah.[p]
Well, I like Kirishima-sensei too, but speaking of Kirishima-sensei, I wonder what's up with their recent outfit.[p]
The skirt is really short and it's kind of...[p]
sexy, or rather...[p]
unusual, isn't it?[p]
#Fujino
That's not true at all.[p]
They look really good in it and it's very lovely, isn't it?[p]
#Hayase
But it's not like Kirishima-sensei...[p]
Did something happen?[p]
#Fujino
What do you mean by something?[p]
#Hayase
For example...[p]
did they get a boyfriend or something?[p]
#Fujino
Huh, a boyfriend...!?[p]
Th-that's...[p]
unexpected, especially for Kirishima-sensei...[p]
#Hayase
Why not?[p]
They're so beautiful, it wouldn't be strange for them to have a boyfriend.[p]
#Fujino
But...[p]
to think that Kirishima-sensei has a boyfriend...[p]
That's...[p]
me...[p]
#Hayase
W-Well, it's not like it's been confirmed or anything![p]
They just changed their outfit, but I think their personality is still the same as always...[p]
maybe![p]
#Fujino
R-Right...?[p]
#Hayase
Y-Yeah, yeah.[p]
Kirishima-sensei seems to dislike men.[p]
It's probably just a change of pace, I'm sure![p]

#Nikuyama
It's called exposing skin, but when it comes to competitions, we have to compete in front of a large crowd in this attire.[p]
If you're embarrassed about it, then it's no good.[p]
#Kirishima
That is...[p]
true, but secretly filming female athletes has become a problem worldwide...[p]
#Nikuyama
It's just a matter of debate, and the rules haven't been established yet.[p]
Moreover, that is a problem with the way it is shared on social media, not a problem with taking photos itself.[p]
#Kirishima
That is...[p]
#Nikuyama
There wouldn't be a problem if you didn't publicly share these photos without permission.[p]
It's also not good for you to secretly take pictures like a peeping tom.[p]
If you're going to take pictures, do it openly.[p]
#Tanahata
Huh...[p]
Is it okay to openly take pictures?[p]
#Nikuyama
It's better to do it openly rather than secretly filming, right, Kirishima-sensei?[p]
#Kirishima
Y-Yes, that's true.[p]
That way...[p]
#Nikuyama
I will make sure to give proper guidance in that regard.[p]
#Kirishima
I understand...[p]
In that case, I will...[p]

What kind of pictures were you taking?[p]
Show me...[p]
Hey hey, it's all close-ups of butts and crotches![p]

If someone saw these, you wouldn't be able to make any excuses.[p]
#Tanahata
S-Sorry...[p]
#Nikuyama
Don't upload these images anywhere.[p]
Enjoy them for yourself only.[p]
Also, immediately move these image files to a different location and erase any traces.[p]
#Tanahata
Y-Yes.[p]
#Nikuyama
Also, make sure to take pictures of the boys and other club activities as well.[p]
It will serve as camouflage.[p]
#Tanahata
Yes![p]
Th-Thank you very much![p]
I-I never expected Nikuyama-sensei to be such an understanding teacher...[p]
I'm really glad that you're our advisor, sensei.[p]
#Nikuyama
Hmph, well, I was lucky that Kirishima was the one I dealt with today and she helped me out.[p]
But if you ever cause any trouble, I won't hesitate to abandon all of you.[p]
#Tanahata
Y-Yes![p]
...[p]
But what do you mean by saying that I was saved because it was Kirishima-sensei...?[p]

#Tonko
Hey, Pinko.[p]
#Pinko
What is it, Tonko?[p]
#Tonko
There's a command called Roaming the School after school, right?[p]
#Pinko
Yes, there is.[p]
It's called Roaming the School and it's happening right now.[p]
#Tonko
Yeah, that's right.[p]
It seems like this doesn't have any impact on the game's progress at all.[p]
#Pinko
Huh, really?[p]
So there's no flag triggered or anything like that here?[p]
#Tonko
It seems like there's nothing at all.[p]
Honestly, you can clear the game without roaming the school even once.[p]
#Pinko
Oh, I see.[p]
Then what is the purpose of the command?[p]
#Tonko
It's meant to enhance the atmosphere of the game.[p]
In other words, by introducing characters and complementing the story here, it allows for a deeper emotional connection to the main storyline.[p]
#Pinko
I see.[p]
Well, maybe it's better to roam the school after school every day during the first playthrough.[p]
#Tonko
Yeah, that's right.[p]
If it's too much trouble on the second playthrough, it's okay to go straight home.[p]
#Pinko
One more thing to note is that if you choose the correct command in one shot during lunch break the day after a mandatory event after school, you'll skip the event after school.[p]
#Tonko
Huh, then how can someone who definitely wants to see all the after-school events do it?[p]
#Pinko
I see.[p]
Well, if you definitely want to see all the after-school events, then be careful not to progress the story during lunch break on the day after a mandatory event after school.[p]
Just make sure to roam the school during after school by choosing Roaming the School, and you'll be fine.[p]
#Tonko
I see.[p]
If you choose the Do Nothing command, it's guaranteed.[p]
...[p]
But I wonder if there are people who want to see all the after-school events without missing any?[p]
#Pinko
Well...?[p]
#
I see...[p]
It was helpful.[p]

The baseball team is practicing.[p]
The district qualifiers for summer are starting soon, so it's the final push now.[p]
Our baseball team isn't a powerhouse, but we have a decent level.[p]
We haven't made it to Koshien, but we've been doing well in recent years, and this year, there's still a chance, although it's like winning the lottery.[p]
Our ace, Higashikawa, is a skilled left-handed pitcher.[p]
He doesn't have a fast ball speed, but he has solid pitching.[p]
The batting lineup also has some good players.[p]
Especially our third batter, Kumada, is a batter who can hit to all fields, and our cleanup batter, Sasakura, has power and is strong in crucial moments.[p]
However, it's a problem that our ace relies on defense to get outs and makes many mistakes in the field.[p]
Also, our second and subsequent pitchers are not as strong, which is a downgrade.[p]
If we advance and have many consecutive games, the key will be how we can rest our ace.[p]
Anyway, I hope we can win as many games as possible without any regrets...[p]
What?[p]
Even I will support the baseball team![p]

I was wondering if you could be a model for some photos...[p]

Um, well, uh, we, the photography club...[p]
um...[p]
we wanted to take portrait photos as a club activity...[p]

That's right.[p]
Fujino-san would be the perfect subject, and I'm sure we can take some great photos.[p]

Um...[p]
I'm a little embarrassed about the photos...[p]

me being a model...[p]

impossible...[p]

#Kimoto & Tabata
Ah, Professor Nikuyama...[p]
#Nikuyama
You guys...[p]
your way of inviting is just too clumsy.[p]
#Tanahata
Huh...?[p]
#Nikuyama
I saw it.[p]
Choosing the school's top beauty as the model for a cosplay photoshoot is already reckless in the first place...[p]
#Kimoto
Y-Yes...[p]
It was impossible after all.[p]
#Nikuyama
No, if we had invited her properly, it would have worked.[p]
Fujino is naive and kind-hearted, after all.[p]
We didn't make a mistake in choosing her as the target.[p]
#Tanahata
R-Really?[p]
#Nikuyama
If we had pushed harder, it would have worked.[p]
We shouldn't have brought up the costume.[p]
#Kimoto
Ah...[p]
#Nikuyama
If we had made her think that we were just going to take a few pictures while still in her school uniform, she probably would have agreed.[p]
And once the shoot started, it would have been in our hands.[p]
After taking a few pictures in her uniform to help her relax, we could have smoothly transitioned to saying something like, Now let's change into this, and naturally moved on to cosplay photos.[p]
There was a high possibility that it could have happened.[p]
#Tanahata
I-I see...[p]
Damn it...[p]
#Kimoto
W-Was that kind of approach...[p]
Did we rush too much...[p]
#Nikuyama
Well, for you guys at the bottom of the school caste to approach Fujino like that...[p]
I'll give you credit for your courage.[p]
Next time, do it more skillfully.[p]
Let me know when the photoshoot is confirmed.[p]
#Tanahata & Kimoto
Y-Yes.[p]
#Nikuyama
(Virgin ero power is really something else.[p]
Just wanting to take cosplay photos gives them so much more energy and motivation than usual.[p]

Why?[p]
You're close with Fujino-san, right?[p]
Don't you know something that Fujino-san would be happy with?[p]
#Hayase
I-I don't know about that.[p]
Ayame's family is rich, so they probably already have whatever they want, right?[p]
#Ogata
I see...[p]
I guess that's how it is.[p]
I thought I could stand out from the others on this occasion, but I was being naive.[p]
#Hayase
Ah, so you like Ayame.[p]
There are a lot of rivals, so I think it's impossible...[p]
#Ogata
But it's not impossible, right?[p]
If you give up from the start thinking it's reckless, it'll definitely be impossible.[p]
#Hayase
W-Well then...[p]
how about manga?[p]
I heard their parents are strict and don't let them read at all.[p]
They were really happy when I lent them some occasionally...[p]
#Ogata
Oh, manga![p]

Thank you![p]
Oops, I have to go practice soon.[p]

My head is starting to hurt.[p]
Is this what they call gyaru language?[p]
They're using words that I don't understand at all.[p]
I couldn't grasp the meaning at all.[p]
I hope they're not doing any dangerous drugs or something...[p]
Well, whatever.[p]
It's probably just a stupid conversation.[p]
I'll leave them alone and go home...[p]

#Female Student A
Hey, have you heard the news?[p]
Our birth rate is at its lowest, 870,000.[p]
Isn't the declining birth rate a serious issue?[p]
#Female Student B
Seriously, it's bad.[p]
If the number of young people decreases, consumption will decrease, money won't circulate, and the economy will worsen.[p]
#Female Student A
If the birth rate decreases, everyone will start using condoms, right?[p]
Sorry, but if the economy worsens, it will become even more difficult to have children.[p]
It's a vicious cycle.[p]
#Female Student B
What about Love Machines?[p]
Are they downers?[p]
(I wonder what will happen to Japan's future.[p]
)[p]
#Female Student A
But it's ambiguous, right?[p]
It's weird to have confidence without any ideas (but I don't understand the logic of accepting immigrants either.[p]
It's meaningless to maintain national power without being able to preserve our Japanese identity).[p]
#Female Student B
Yeah, that's right.[p]
But on a global scale, population growth is actually the problem.[p]
#Female Student A
Yeah, like 7 billion?[p]
8 billion?[p]
The population of the Earth is clearly exceeding its carrying capacity, right?[p]
#Female Student B
They're saying things like SDGs, but it's just a drop in the bucket.[p]
They're running away.[p]
(They're talking about SDGs, but it's like putting a band-aid on a gunshot wound.[p]
They're avoiding the fundamental issue of population.[p]
)[p]
#Female Student A
Seriously, it's divine.[p]
One-child policy is impossible (Religion is the barrier.[p]
)[p]
#Female Student B
But![p]
It's like China's super energetic, right?[p]
(Indeed, in China, where the one-child policy was once implemented, the power of religion is weak.[p]
But in China's case, it might also be because of communism, right?[p]
)[p]
#Female Student A
Yeah, that's right.[p]
Like Super Free, the strongest?[p]
(That might be true too.[p]
Population control seems to be connected to human rights issues.[p]
)[p]
#Female Student B
(Not that I'm affirming communism though)[p]
#Female Student A
LOL, that's true.[p]

There are still quite a few students left, and the male students are talking about something.[p]
#Male Student A
Hey, do you know about the rumors about Kirishima-sensei?[p]
#Male Student B
What rumors?[p]
#Male Student A
Kirishima-sensei has been dressing really sexy lately.[p]
I heard rumors that they might have gotten a boyfriend.[p]
#Male Student B
A man for Kirishima-sensei?[p]
Seriously?![p]
Our admired Kirishima-sensei...[p]
Well, they're so beautiful, so it wouldn't be strange if they had a boyfriend.[p]
So, do you know who it is?[p]
#Male Student A
Well...[p]
I heard that it might be Nikuyama.[p]
#Male Student B
Huh?![p]
Nikuyama?![p]
The PE teacher?[p]
A gorilla?[p]
No way, that can't be true![p]
There's no way that gorilla and Kirishima-sensei would be a good match![p]
Besides, those two used to have a lot of animosity towards each other, right?[p]
#Male Student A
Yeah, that's right.[p]
Apparently, Kirishima-sensei has been going in and out of the PE teacher's office during lunch break almost every day recently.[p]
So there's a rumor going around that they might be dating.[p]
#Male Student B
No...[p]
that can't be true.[p]
Maybe they're just talking about work or something.[p]
The idea of those two dating...[p]
it's impossible.[p]
#Male Student A
Well, I don't think it's true either...[p]
But if it were, that would be the worst.[p]
#Male Student B
It's not just the worst, it's beyond that.[p]
Just imagining our beloved Kirishima-sensei with that damn gorilla...[p]
It makes me feel like I'm going insane.[p]
#Male Student A
Seriously.[p]
That sexual harassment gorilla should just date a female gorilla and be quiet.[p]
#Male Student B
Yeah, yeah.[p]
#
...[p]
Those bastards are saying whatever they want...[p]
Should I just go out and punch them...[p]
Well, whatever, I don't care about those guys.[p]
They can't do anything anyway, those kids.[p]
I'll make sure to give Kirishima a proper payback for calling me a gorilla, hehehe...[p]

Ah, Vice Principal.[p]
#Vice Principal
Thank you for your hard work patrolling.[p]
#Nikuyama
Ah, no.[p]
It's a time when problems are likely to occur as we approach summer.[p]
I need to patrol thoroughly.[p]
Hahaha.[p]

Thank you for your cooperation.[p]
#Nikuyama
Leave it to me.[p]

Mr.[p]
Nikuyama, I've heard rumors that you often disappear somewhere during class and leave the students unattended.[p]
#Nikuyama
Eh!?[p]
Ah, w-well...[p]

#Nikuyama
A-Actually, I pretend to leave my seat and observe the students from the shadows.[p]
#Vice Principal
Huh, observing from the shadows...?[p]
What exactly...?[p]
#Nikuyama
I observe whether the students are working diligently even when there is no teacher present, and I reflect that in my evaluations.[p]
#Vice Principal
I see...[p]
So that's what you're doing.[p]
You're trying to discern not only the students' abilities but also their true nature.[p]
#Nikuyama
Yes, that's right.[p]
#Vice Principal
Well, you truly are an experienced teacher.[p]
I had thought that you were neglecting your classes and slacking off somewhere.[p]
#Nikuyama
Hahaha, there's no way I would do something like that.[p]
#Vice Principal
My apologies.[p]
In that case, I'll leave the rounds to you.[p]

Phew, I managed to deceive them well.[p]
I haven't been highly evaluated as a teacher until now, but if I can use the brainwashing machine effectively, I might be able to improve the Vice Principal's evaluation.[p]
Once Kirishima's brainwashing is complete, maybe I'll try something like that too...[p]

P-Please, I'm begging you.[p]
#Hayase
W-Why me...[p]
If it's a model, there are cuter girls like Ayame and...[p]
#Tabata
I asked Fujino-san, but they turned me down.[p]
#Hayase
Ah, so Ayame turned you down first...[p]
Well, I guess that makes sense.[p]
I've been rejected by many people before, so it's no surprise you approached me.[p]
I'm not attractive like a girl and I have a small chest like a boy...[p]
#Kimoto
Ah, no, it's not like that...[p]
#Tabata
If you wear a wig, your hair will be fine, and if you put in some padding, your chest will be okay.[p]
#Hayase
・・・[p]

So please, I'm begging you![p]

Damn it![p]

#Nikuyama
Hey[p]
#Tabata
Nikuyama[p]
#Kimoto
W-were you watching?[p]
#Nikuyama
You guys...[p]
are you idiots?[p]
#Tabata
Huh...?[p]
#Nikuyama
Your way of recruiting is too bad.[p]
With that kind of approach, even someone who was interested would lose motivation.[p]
#Tabata
Huh...[p]
I thought I properly tried to recruit them.[p]
What did I do wrong...?[p]
#Nikuyama
Why did you mention that you invited Fujino first?[p]
#Tabata
Eh...[p]
Because I was told to invite Fujino...[p]
I already invited them.[p]
#Nikuyama
You should have just kept quiet about that.[p]
The person who was approached first would be happier thinking that they were the first one to be called.[p]
#Kimoto
I-I see...[p]
#Nikuyama
Anyway, since you're recruiting, you should praise the other person.[p]
There's no woman who feels bad when they're praised, especially Haya-se.[p]
Compared to their best friend Fujino, they feel insecure about their own attractiveness as a woman.[p]
So you need to tell them that it's not true and give them confidence.[p]
#Tabata
Ah...[p]
#Nikuyama
Saying things like Just wear a wig or put in some padding, and you'll be fine...[p]
They'll definitely feel like they're being denied and get depressed.[p]
#Tabata
Damn...[p]
I see...[p]
#Nikuyama
The secret to success in recruiting is understanding women's hearts.[p]
Well, I guess you guys who get nervous just talking to girls wouldn't understand that.[p]
#Kimoto
Uh...[p]
#Tabata
It hurts...[p]
But why is the teacher so knowledgeable about scouting?[p]
#Nikuyama
That's the autobiography of Enzan, the legendary pick-up artist from the Nanpa-themed AV...[p]
But never mind, that's not important![p]
Well, there are still girls in the school.[p]
Anyway, you guys should do your best as if you're practicing talking to girls.[p]
#Tabata & Kimoto
Yes[p]

No, Vice Principal.[p]
That child is not an elementary school student, but a bona fide student of our school.[p]
#Vice Principal
So, that child's older sister is here at the school, right?[p]
#Nikuyama
No, that child is a student of this school.[p]
#Vice Principal
Huh...?[p]
What are you saying?[p]
There's no way that's true.[p]
They don't look like an elementary school student at all, do they?[p]
#Nikuyama
It may seem that way, but they are not an elementary school student.[p]
I understand that it's hard to believe, but...[p]
#Tsuyama
I am a student of this school.[p]
#Vice Principal
That's so stupid...[p]
#Nikuyama
Excuse me.[p]
Please take a look.[p]
What is the constitution that is considered to be the precursor of the democratic constitution established in Germany in the early 20th century?[p]
#Tsuyama
It's the Weimar Constitution.[p]
#Nikuyama
How do you translate selected carefully into English?[p]

#Nikuyama
Where is Langerhans Island?[p]

After-school gymnasium is filled with so much energy, it's suffocating.[p]
Over there is the basketball club, and over here is the volleyball club.[p]
In that corner is the gymnastics club, and in that corner is the table tennis club...[p]
And each of them has both male and female members, so there's competition for space.[p]
Our school isn't weak in sports, but we don't have any standout teams that are particularly strong.[p]
It's not like we get eliminated in the first round everywhere, but we don't have the skills to compete in national tournaments either.[p]
I think it would be great if we had one strong club that could help promote our school...[p]
Well, more than that, what catches my attention are the tight bodies of the female club members.[p]
The girls in the volleyball club have great volume and attractive bodies...[p]
It's irresistible when their breasts bounce and sway while they jump.[p]
The girls in the basketball club are slim and have beautiful legs.[p]
It's hard to resist those slender legs.[p]
The girls in the gymnastics club may be small, but they are flexible and have great figures.[p]
Their soft bodies would be enjoyable in various positions during sex...[p]

Yeah, it's different from our image.[p]
#Tabata
They have a good face, but they lack substance.[p]
#Kimoto
In the first place, it would be pointless to approach them.[p]

The two members of the photography club don't like gyaru girls, huh?[p]
Well, I can understand feeling a bit intimidated by overly flashy girls, but gyaru is also a genre with divided preferences.[p]
Personally, I don't like extreme gyaru girls like the ones from the past, but someone like Akai is totally fine...[p]
Maybe I'll watch some gyaru-themed AV today...[p]

Hmm, I'll listen in on what kind of conversation those delinquent students are having...[p]
#Delinquent A
I heard that there was a fight between Nishi High and Suna Construction in front of the station yesterday.[p]
#Delinquent B
Ah, I heard about it.[p]
They said that the Destruction-type Youtuber Miyamoto went on a rampage, right?[p]
#Delinquent C
Seriously?![p]
Then that video will be uploaded soon.[p]
I'm looking forward to it.[p]
#Delinquent A
It seems like Non-Caffeine Iguchi from Suna Construction has shown up.[p]
#Delinquent C
That guy is amazing.[p]
He's so conscious about his health, his body is in incredible shape.[p]
#Delinquent B
But if it comes to this, I bet Yoko Yamashita, who is close to Miyamoto from Higashi High, won't stay quiet about the Revenge Porn either.[p]
#Delinquent A
Ah, in Suna Construction, there's still Heattech Hamaguchi and the Asymmetry Shimada brothers.[p]
#Delinquent C
Looks like there's gonna be some excitement...![p]
#
......[p]
Recently, even the nicknames for delinquents have changed...[p]
In the past, they were called 'Mad Dog' or 'Razor', but what's with this 'Heattech'?[p]
Just a bunch of cold-sensitive wimps.[p]
Well, I don't really care about kids fighting.[p]
Let's just leave them alone......[p]

#Hayase
What are you talking about?[p]
Practice is about to start, you know.[p]
#Ogata
Ah, yeah.[p]
I heard that the baseball club and the track and field club won't have practice this Sunday because the field is unavailable.[p]
#Hayase
Yeah, it seems so.[p]
The track and field club doesn't have many days off, but the baseball club rarely gets a break, right?[p]
#Ogata
Ah, yeah.[p]
S-so, um...[p]
on Sunday...[p]
how about going to see a movie or something?[p]
#Hayase
Huh...?[p]
Is that...[p]
#Ogata

you like Ayame, right...?[p]

but...[p]
you see, while I was seeking advice about that...[p]
I realized my own feelings.[p]
#Hayase
Huh...?[p]
#Ogata
I realized that my feelings towards Fujino-san were just admiration, and I figured out who I truly love![p]
#Hayase
K-Kouhei...[p]
D-Don't say embarrassing things out loud like that![p]
#Ogata
S-Sorry...[p]

Yeah, it's too good to be true.[p]
#Ogata
I'm sorry...[p]
#Hayase
But...[p]
I think I'm more suitable for Kouhei than a high-class beauty like Ayame.[p]
#Ogata
...[p]
Eh![p]
So, will you go out with me!?[p]
#Hayase
I-I'll go out with you.[p]
#Ogata
Y-Yatta!![p]
#Hayase
Idiot...[p]
I've liked you all along, you know...[p]
#Ogata
Huh, did you say something just now?[p]
#Hayase
No, more importantly, we have to go to club activities quickly or we'll get scolded.[p]

Let's go![p]

After-school events are now over.[p]

#Pinko
You want to ask about Ending 1, don't you?[p]
#Tonko
Ending 1 is actually quite difficult to see.[p]
#Pinko
I see.[p]
Well, I'll tell you straight up, the key is Outdoor Training.[p]
#Tonko
That thing where we take Kirishima-sensei around in the middle of the night.[p]
#Pinko
Yes, if you do that every day, there are times when something different happens.[p]
#Tonko
Watching that event is the condition for reaching Ending 1.[p]
#Pinko
Actually, that event doesn't happen randomly, it occurs on a specific day.[p]
#Tonko
The hint is Kirishima-sensei's panties.[p]
If you check her underwear during the day and she's wearing panties of a certain color, try doing Outdoor Training after school.[p]

I'm praying for your success.[p]

It's an ending that anyone can reach.[p]

#Pinko
But since you've come this far, maybe I'll let you in on a little secret~[p]
#Tonko
This is a secret just between us~[p]
#Pinko
I'm the one with red hair on the right, my older sister is Pin-ko.[p]
#Tonko
The one with green hair on the left is me, Tonko.[p]
Surprisingly, we may look like it, but we're actually twins.[p]
Isn't it unexpected?[p]
#Pinko
Where is it?![p]
Anyone can see that we're twins![p]
#Tonko
I'm just saying.[p]
#Pinko
I'm in my second year.[p]
#Tonko
I'm a first-year student.[p]
#Pinko
Why are you saying that?![p]
We're saying we're twins, you know![p]
#Tonko
Hehe, both of us are second-year students.[p]
#Pinko
Seriously, cut it out.[p]
#Tonko
Both of us are in the homecoming club.[p]
#Pinko
I see.[p]
#Tonko
After school, we often stay behind like this and chat together.[p]
#Pinko
This landing is our usual spot.[p]
If you come here, you can usually find us.[p]
#Tonko
Huh, you're asking if there's no sex scene between the two of us?[p]
There's none of that.[p]
#Pinko
Unfortunately, there isn't.[p]
We're sorry to all of our fans.[p]
#Tonko
I wonder if we even have any fans.[p]
#Pinko
Well, there might actually be some fans, you know.[p]
#Tonko
Or rather, we...[p]
exist as mob characters solely to give hints to the players...[p]
#Pinko
Did you suddenly become so frank!?[p]
#Tonko
At first, there were no graphics...[p]
so we hastily had them drawn, but the faces and everything were just done randomly...[p]
#Pinko
W-Well...[p]
let's just be grateful that there are graphics, hahaha.[p]
#Tonko
We don't even have last names...[p]
#Pinko
Well, well...[p]

#Pinko
Did you suddenly become so frank!?[p]
And what's with the way you're speaking!?[p]
You didn't talk like that just a moment ago, right!?[p]
#Tonko
Character development is important.[p]
This kind of diligent effort is crucial.[p]
It's crucial, Ton.[p]
#Pinko
Effort...[p]
what kind of effort?[p]
#Tonko
It's already decided, you know.[p]
I'll appeal to be included in the next work![p]
I'll appeal, Ton![p]
#Pinko
I-I'm impressed by your strength, even though you're my little sister![p]
Yes, I'll do my best too![p]
No, Pinko will do her best![p]
Let's work together and give it our all, Pinko![p]
#Tonko
No, big sister's way of speaking ends with yansu.[p]
#Pinko
I don't like it![p]
Why are you Ton and I'm the only one who's Yansu![p]
#Tonko
You're making a Yansu face.[p]
#Pinko
What kind of face is a Yansu face!?[p]
#Tonko
It's more like a petty face, or rather, a poor-looking face, or maybe even a rat...[p]
#Pinko
You have the same face as me!?[p]
#Tonko
Ahh, that's right![p]
I want to die![p]

Well...[p]
but having big breasts isn't always a good thing, you know?[p]
It can be tiring on the shoulders...[p]
and sometimes there's no cute bra available.[p]
#Tonko
It's just a small difference![p]
Why are you acting like you have big breasts![p]
#Pinko
By the way, the difference in the shadow of our uniforms is also influenced by the size of our breasts, so that's included in this.[p]

#Pinko
That's right![p]
The cuffs of our uniforms were slightly different~![p]
#Tonko
You noticed something like this well.[p]
#Pinko
Your observation skills are amazing.[p]
#Tonko
They're probably staring at women on the train and stuff.[p]
#Pinko
Don't say unpleasant things![p]
I haven't done anything, probably![p]

Correct![p]
The hem of our skirts is slightly different.[p]
#Tonko
Hey, where are you looking?![p]
Pervert![p]
#Pinko
No, finding mistakes is just how it is with this game![p]
#Tonko
But if you're buying a game like this, there's no doubt you're a pervert, right?[p]
#Pinko
Ugh...[p]
I can't argue back.[p]

#Pinko
Good work~[p]
#Tonko
How about it?[p]
Did you find them all?[p]
#Pinko
You realized that we're quite different, right?[p]
#Tonko
Even if we're identical twins, we're still different individuals.[p]
Differences start to show after living for so many years.[p]
#Pinko
Our personalities are different too.[p]
It was a game to make you understand that.[p]
#Tonko
Actually, I just made it as practice using the functions of TyranoBuilder.[p]
#Pinko
Is that so?![p]
#Tonko
What I realized by making it...[p]
is that because the cursor becomes a finger, it's easy to understand.[p]
#Pinko
Well, it's not a function for finding mistakes...[p]
But depending on the idea, it could be used for various things, right?[p]
Like touching the body in erotic scenes, or using it for investigation commands in detective stories.[p]
#Tonko
Yeah, like rubbing the hump of a two-humped camel to make it smaller, or stuffing freshly cooked rice into a piggy bank.[p]
#Pinko
Your ideas are unique![p]
